# How it works?
Gnome scripts
GNOME Files, formerly and internally known as Nautilus, is the official file manager for the GNOME desktop Nautilus script is an executable shell script that is placed in a special scripts directory so that the Nautilus graphical shell can find it. This allows you to extend the functionality of the file browser to do just about anything.
 
Do you have a question?


> [!NOTE]
> if you have differnet file manager you have to find your script path

> [!TIP]
> Right click on any script and select an icon for it. The icons are available in the icon folder
> The scripts do not have .sh extension because when they are placed in the menu, the name becomes long. I removed it because it is not necessary. You can change the name.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> dot forget to  chmod a+x [yourscript]

> [!WARNING]
> 

> [!CAUTION]
> You can customize the scripts according to your needs

:+1: This change looks great - it's ready to use! :shipit:
